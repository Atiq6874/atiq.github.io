<h3> What's New?</h3>


<p>April 2022:  I will be presenting my advanced manufacturing paper in society for economic measurement conference in August. Never been to Canada, very excited. Also I presented & discussed in FMCG from Monash University. Good that my co-author Will Li also presented our paper on common ownership and we won the run-up for best paper award!</p>
