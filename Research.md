### Working Papers:
#### Contagious crime: How cryptocurrency manipulation spills into stocks ”, Working Paper.*(Under Review)*
*(with Talis Putnins and Anirudh Dhawan)*

We show that a type of market manipulation popularized in cryptocurrency markets is now also found in stock markets, an effect we term “crime contagion”. Manipulators gather traders in pseudo-anonymous online forums (e.g., Telegram) where they co-ordinate pump-and-dump attacks on stocks, mirroring schemes conceived in cryptocurrencies. We find such manipulations in Australia, India, and the US during 2020–2022. They generate millions of dollars of trading and returns of 26%–107%. We find direct regulatory intervention in forums is effective in curbing this activity. The findings illustrate a negative externality of unregulated markets: breeding misconduct that spills into other markets.

#### Obscure disclosures: Strategic information concealment by substantial shareholders, Working Paper.
*(with Talis Putnins, Sean Foley, and Vinay Patel)*

#### On the predictive power of tweet sentiments and attention on bitcoin*
*(with Sandy Suardi and Bin Liu)* 

This paper investigates the predictive power of information contained in social media tweets on bitcoin market dynamics. Using Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning (VADER), we extract useful information from tweets and construct two factors – sentiment dispersion (SD) and investor attention (IA) – to test their predictive power. We show that investors face greater return volatility for rising sentiment dispersion associated with more significant market uncertainty. Further, IA is found to predict bitcoin trading volume but not returns and volatility. Finally, we design an IA-induced trading strategy that yields superior performance to the passive buy-and-hold strategy in 2018. However, it does not deliver superior performance in other years during the sample period suggesting that investor attention alone as a trading parameter does not produce superior performance over the long term.
