# Measuring Manufacturing and Process Innovation, Application to Productivity and Growth} (with Elvira Sojli and Wing Wah Tham) (Job Market Paper)
	- We propose a new time-varying measure of advanced manufacturing and process innovations based on patent invention titles from 1926 to 2019 across 51 countries. Using this measure, we provide evidence that these innovations are important for firm and aggregate economic growth through technological spillover to product innovations and increased profitability. We find that patents with advanced processes have higher forward citations, number of claims, and economic value than product patents of the same technology class and cohort. Firms with higher quality process innovation are associated with higher profits, sales, capital, employment, and total factor productivity in the short run, while product innovation plays a larger role in the longer run. At the aggregate level, both advanced manufacturing and product innovations are positively related to U.S. economic growth. In cross-country analysis, we find that product innovation is more important than process innovation for emerging countries with low labor costs for growth convergence towards the U.S. economy, but the opposite holds for productivity.
