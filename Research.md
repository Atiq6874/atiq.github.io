* Measuring Manufacturing and Process Innovation, Application to Productivity and Growth (with Elvira Sojli and Wing Wah Tham) (Job Market Paper) 

We propose a new time-varying measure of advanced manufacturing and process innovations based on patent invention titles from 1926 to 2019 across 51 countries. Using this measure, we provide evidence that these innovations are important for firm and aggregate economic growth through technological spillover to product innovations and increased profitability. We find that patents with advanced processes have higher forward citations, number of claims, and economic value than product patents of the same technology class and cohort. Firms with higher quality process innovation are associated with higher profits, sales, capital, employment, and total factor productivity in the short run, while product innovation plays a larger role in the longer run. At the aggregate level, both advanced manufacturing and product innovations are positively related to U.S. economic growth. In cross-country analysis, we find that product innovation is more important than process innovation for emerging countries with low labor costs for growth convergence towards the U.S. economy, but the opposite holds for productivity.

- Common Ownership and Antitrust Enforcement: Evidence from the Court (with Huaizhou Li, Ronald Masulis and Jason Zein)

An increasing number of publicly-owned rival firms are jointly held by a small group of large institutional investors. This has led to serious concerns regarding the economic implications of such common ownership. We analyze U.S. legal cases to uncover links between common ownership and antitrust litigation. This approach allows us to establish a direct connection between common ownership and anti-competitive product market behavior. We empirically show that there is a significant positive relationship between common ownership and the probability that a pair of firms face the same antitrust prosecution. We use mergers between financial institutions as exogenous variations in common ownership to provide causal evidence on this proposed relation. We also show that firm-pairs subject to antitrust litigation are characterized by more socially connected directors, pointing to a possible coordination mechanism.
